# Sorting-In-Data-Structure-Using-Java.
Sorting in Java organizes data in ascending or descending order. Key algorithms include **Selection Sort**, **Bubble Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, **Merge Sort**, and **Quick Sort**, each with unique time/space complexities. Java's flexibility makes it ideal for implementing and testing these algorithms, optimizing data management and retrieval.
Sorting Algorithms in Data Structures Using Java
This repository provides an overview of common sorting algorithms implemented in Java. Sorting is a fundamental concept in computer science and is widely used in various applications. Below is a detailed explanation of sorting algorithms, their implementations, and how they work.
Overview of Sorting Algorithms
Sorting algorithms are used to arrange elements in a specific order (ascending or descending). They are essential for optimizing data search, retrieval, and analysis. The choice of sorting algorithm depends on factors like data size, memory usage, and performance requirements.

Types of Sorting Algorithms
Selection Sort: Repeatedly selects the smallest element and swaps it with the first unsorted element.

Bubble Sort: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

Insertion Sort: Builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting each element into its correct position.

Merge Sort: Divides the array into two halves, sorts them recursively, and merges the sorted halves.

Quick Sort: Picks a pivot element, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively sorts the sub-arrays
